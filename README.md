An architecture developed and revised by the FilledStacks community. This architecture was initially a version of MVVM as described in this video. Since then Filledstacks app development team has built 6 production applications with various requirements. This experience along with countless requests for improvements and common functionality is what sparked the creation of this architecture package. It aims to provide common functionalities to make app development easier as well as code principles to use during development to ensure your code stays maintainable.
